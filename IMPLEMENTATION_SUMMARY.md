# YARN.com Security Implementation - Complete Solution

## 🎯 Problem Solved
Implemented comprehensive input sanitization and validation to prevent XSS attacks and ensure data integrity in the YARN.com application.

## ✅ Requirements Met

### 1. Express-validator for Input Validation ✓
- Added `express-validator@^7.0.1` to package.json
- Created comprehensive validation rules for threads and strands
- Implemented middleware for handling validation errors

### 2. HTML Content Sanitization ✓
- Added `dompurify@^3.0.5` and `jsdom@^22.1.0` for server-side HTML sanitization
- Sanitizes all user inputs (thread descriptions, strand content, contributor names)
- Only allows safe HTML tags: `p`, `br`, `strong`, `em`, `u`, `ol`, `ul`, `li`
- Removes all HTML attributes to prevent event handlers

### 3. Proper Error Handling ✓
- Structured error responses with clear validation messages
- Global error handling middleware in server.js
- Security-conscious error disclosure (different levels for dev/prod)
- Threat detection with specific error messages

### 4. Length and Format Validations ✓
- **Thread validation**: Title (3-200 chars), Description (10-1000 chars), Tags (max 10, 2-30 chars each)
- **Strand validation**: ThreadID (MongoDB ObjectId), ContributorName (2-100 chars), Content (5-2000 chars)
- Pattern matching for allowed characters
- MongoDB ID format validation

## 🛡️ Security Features Implemented

### XSS Protection
- HTML sanitization using DOMPurify
- Script tag detection and removal
- Event handler detection (`onclick`, `onload`, etc.)
- JavaScript protocol detection (`javascript:`)
- Iframe and object tag removal

### Additional Security Measures
- SQL injection pattern detection
- Path traversal protection
- Security headers (CSP, XSS Protection, Frame Options)
- Input length limits and payload size limits
- Parameter pollution prevention

## 📁 Files Modified/Created

### Modified Files
1. **`package.json`** - Added security dependencies
2. **`routes/threads.js`** - Added validation middleware and enhanced error handling
3. **`routes/strands.js`** - Added validation middleware and enhanced error handling
4. **`server.js`** - Enhanced with security middleware and global error handling

### New Files
1. **`middleware/validation.js`** - Input validation and sanitization logic
2. **`middleware/security.js`** - Security utilities and threat detection
3. **`test/security-validation-test.js`** - Security testing and demonstration
4. **`SECURITY.md`** - Comprehensive security documentation

## 🧪 Testing Results

### XSS Protection Test Results
```
✓ "<script>alert('XSS')</script>" → Cleaned to empty string
✓ "<iframe src='javascript:alert(1)'>" → Removed completely  
✓ "<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>" → Removed completely
✓ "javascript:alert('XSS')" → Detected as threat
```

### SQL Injection Detection
```
✓ "'; DROP TABLE threads; --" → Detected and blocked
✓ "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1 OR 1=1" → Detected and blocked
✓ "UNION SELECT password FROM users" → Detected and blocked
```

### Path Traversal Protection
```
✓ "../../../etc/passwd" → Detected and blocked
✓ "%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f" → Detected and blocked
```

## 🚀 API Usage Examples

### Valid Request (Success)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/threads \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "My Story Thread",
    "description": "This is a valid thread description with proper content.",
    "tags": ["story", "community", "experience"]
  }'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Thread created successfully",
  "thread": {
    "_id": "...",
    "title": "My Story Thread",
    "description": "This is a valid thread description with proper content.",
    "tags": ["story", "community", "experience"],
    "createdAt": "2025-10-08T..."
  }
}
```

### XSS Attempt (Blocked)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/threads \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "<script>alert(\"XSS\")</script>Malicious Title",
    "description": "Contains <iframe src=\"javascript:alert(1)\"></iframe>"
  }'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Input contains potentially harmful content",
  "field": "title",
  "threats": ["XSS"]
}
```

### Validation Error (Clear Messages)
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/threads \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "AB",
    "description": "Too short"
  }'
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "message": "Validation failed",
  "errors": [
    {
      "field": "title",
      "message": "Title must be between 3 and 200 characters",
      "value": "AB"
    },
    {
      "field": "description", 
      "message": "Description must be between 10 and 1000 characters",
      "value": "Too short"
    }
  ]
}
```
